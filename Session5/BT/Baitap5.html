    <h1>5.Groups of selectors</h1>
    <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual
    selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same
    declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the
    comma.</p>
    <div class="border">
        <p>
            CSS example: <br> <br>
            In this example, we condense three rules identical declarations into one.Thus, <br>
            h1 <br>
            h2 <br>
            h3 <br>
            <br>
            is equivalent to:
            <br> <br>
            h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif}

        </p>
    </div>
